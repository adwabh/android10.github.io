Hi all! I&#8217;m so proud that finally I&#8217;ve created my new blog. Since this is my **12372983** attempt for having a development blog, **I can only promise you that will put all my effort to keep it up to date.** So welcome!

And now that this is my first post I just wanted to share with you a talk about Near Field Communication I gave last year which was requested by a lot of colleagues. Here it is guys! (take into account that the video is in spanish, anyway I promise to explain some examples and use cases soon).

**Enjoy and feel free to comment and give very useful feedback.**

You can find the source code of the example application of both the presentation and video here: <a href="https://github.com/android10/nfc_android_sample" title="https://github.com/android10/nfc_android_sample" target="_blank">https://github.com/android10/nfc_android_sample</a>
