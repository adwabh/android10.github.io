<p class="justify"><span class="boldtext">No technical blog post this time</span>, but I also love to share feelings and sensations, and in this case I want to announce that I will be collaborating with <span class="boldtext">IBM as a Developer Advocate.</span></p> 

<p class="justify"><span class="boldtext">What does that mean then?</span> <span class="underlinetext">Long story short:</span> this is a new team being created in Germany which its main goal is to research and share material around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_computing" target="_blank">Cognitive Computing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">Internet of Things.</a></p>


# My roll

<p class="justify"><span class="boldtext">First of all I'm more committed than ever to the Community.</span> So nothing is going to change: I am more than glad to continue attending events, sharing and giving talks related to lessons learned and knowledge as part of my job. So do not hesitate to <a href="https://twitter.com/fernando_cejas/" target="_blank">invite me!</a> I will also participate more actively on <a href="https://github.com/android10" target="_blank">open source projects</a> and of course I will continue doing one of my passions: <span class="boldtext">mobile development (mainly android).</span></p>


# Why?

<p class="justify"><span class="boldtext">This is not easy to answer,</span> but I will do my best. At <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> I used to be a <span class="boldtext">Mobile Core Engineer, which means I was working on infrastracture code (things that affect the entire application) and libraries which were used by feature teams.</span> It was product related and we had a fixed strategy/roadmap and product backlog belonging to the team. Being in touch with the community and doing open source was not my main roll: please do not get me wrong, <span class="boldtext">I always had support from the company, which is a plus one, and from my perspective, one of the best places with the smartest and nicest people I have ever worked with. I am so grateful!</span></p>  

<p class="justify">On the other hand, at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/" target="_blank">IBM</a> the idea is to <span class="boldtext">do research in the fields mentioned above, and share that knowledge through technical articles, conferences and code samples,</span> thus, creating relationships with developers. With that being said, my decision was more a matter of <span class="boldtext">new challenges</span> and a bit of a <span class="boldtext">career path change</span> (trying new things is something I always encourage to everybody).</p>


# The Future

<p class="justify"><span class="boldtext">Of course it is unpredictable: I do not know whether I will like or not until I start doing my job.</span> There are many challenges on the way, plus I was never part of such a big company, but I have to say, <span class="boldtext">I'm very positive,</span> and of course I will put all my effort in order to do my best. <span class="boldtext">I will definitely keep you posted!</span></p>


# Thanks

<p class="justify">In this paragraph I want to spit out a <span class="boldtext">BIG THANK YOU</span> to all the people supporting my decision plus all of you who contacted and wanted to work with me. Let me also say that <span class="boldtext">I'm not closing any door here,</span> since I'm open to help in any way I can, so again, do not hesitate to ping me via <a href="https://twitter.com/fernando_cejas/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/android10" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fernando_cejas/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Penano" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p class="justify"><span class="boldtext">Sharing knowledge, experiences and exchanging ideas is something I will NOT STOP DOING, no matters what.</span> See you around!</p>
