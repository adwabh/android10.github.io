Hello, my name is Fernando Cejas. I&#8217;m a software engineer currently working [@SoundCloud](https://twitter.com/soundcloud). I have worked at [@Tuenti](https://twitter.com/tuenti) as well and haveÂ organized the GDG Barcelona. I&#8217;m passionate about software engineering and android. I&#8217;m a ruby beginner, speaker, geek and a curious learner. Huge fan of agile methodologies, programming and technology in general.

> I feel passion for mobile development. I&#8217;ve been involved in android development since 2010. My focus areas are: research and development, innovation, best practices, engineering, etc&#8230;

I would like to leave you a phrase that inspires me:

> Kindness is one of the greatest gifts you can bestow upon another. If someone is in need, lend them a helping hand. Do not wait for a thank you. True kindness lies within the act of giving without the expectation of something in return.

I hope you find the content of this blog very useful. Have fun!
